# Up-To-Dev Style Guides

Documents outling and relating to our style guide.

At the moment there is one main document in this repo outlining our general style recomendations, as well as JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Python preferences.

We expect this to guide to grow and be split into individual components during the development cycle, and as we take on more ambitious and larger projects in the future.
